<h1>Steam Mod</h1>
<p>Steam Mod is an advanced Plugin/Mod system that is similar to Cydia in terms of serving modules. The Mod itself is not implemented as a mod on top of another program but is a proof of concept, overlaying a simple IRC client that has multiple hooks in place. The Steam Mod contains a basic IRC client and a plugin store that can change the functionality quite drastically. Steam Mod is themable by means of Java Look and Feel systems. Steam Mod at this time is a POC and still indev, you can use the Steam Mod in any of your work.</p>

<h1>Indev</h1>
<p>At the moment, Steam Mod is in development, it will continue to be in development forever, the original Modification is for minecraft but as a POC it will use the IRC protocol. Iridium Mod might be released, building off the Iridium 3 client and adding certain funcationality (or just become a new client all together)
