<h1>Steam Mod</h1>
<p>What is Steam Mod? Steam Mod is a new client that utilizes a Steam style interface when dealing with a plugin store. The plugins at the moment are hosted on a file one click hoster, a pastehin
file controls the modules plus their information in a very weird style. Everything is parsed and displayed in a UI. The Steam Mod is far from finished and will take a week to get a working
prototype. You may continue to look and study my code as well as help and give me pointers on fixing any mistakes.</p>
